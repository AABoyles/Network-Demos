Note that the SVG directory does not include an equivalent example for [09 - WebGL (Pixi)](https://aaboyles.github.io/Network-Demos/#09---webgl-pixi) as I can't think of an effective way to leverage WebGL/Pixi in the SVG environment that isn't better-achieved by using the more general [GPUjs](https://aaboyles.github.io/Network-Demos/#10---gpujs) or simply foregoing the technology and optimizing other elements of the application.
